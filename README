The dataset is composed by 3 subjects, scanned at the Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE) at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow (UK).
The full database consists of 142 out-of-the-scanner volumes obtained with a MP2RAGE sequence at 0.63 mm3 isotropic resolution, using a 7-Tesla MRI scanner with 32-channel head coil.
These data serve as testing dataset for the paper:

	Svanera, M., Benini, S., Bontempi, D., & Muckli, L. (2020). 
	CEREBRUM-7T: fast and fully-volumetric brain segmentation of out-of-the-scanner 7T MR volumes. 
	bioRxiv.

For every subject, two folders are provided, containing:

* INV1
* INV2
* UNI_Images
